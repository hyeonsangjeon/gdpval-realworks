  "narrative": {
    "overview": "This experiment evaluated the GPT-5.2 Chat model in an elicitation-focused subprocess execution across 220 tasks spanning multiple economic sectors. The run emphasized task completion under elicitation conditions, with the model providing self-assessed QA confidence scores during execution. Overall, 191 tasks completed successfully, yielding an 86.8% task completion rate, while 29 tasks resulted in errors. A relatively high retry count (68 tasks) indicates multiple attempts were often required to reach acceptable task completion.\n\nThe model reported an average self-assessed QA confidence of 5.92/10, with a wide spread from 2 to 9, suggesting moderate confidence in output quality overall and notable variability across tasks. Average latency was high at approximately 21.7 seconds per task, reflecting the computational and reasoning load of the elicitation setup. Key highlights include perfect task completion in the Information sector and consistently strong completion in Government-related tasks, contrasted with lower success rates in Finance and Retail.",
    "quality_analysis": "Self-assessed QA confidence scores clustered around the mid-range, with most sectors averaging between 5.2 and 6.9. Higher confidence was observed in Government and Retail Trade tasks, which may reflect clearer task structure or more standardized response expectations. Lower average QA scores in Information and Health Care suggest that, while tasks were completed, the model expressed less confidence in output completeness or precision.\n\nSector-wise, no single domain exhibited both low completion and low confidence simultaneously, indicating that failures were not strongly correlated with QA confidence alone. Manufacturing and Real Estate showed balanced outcomes with moderate-to-high confidence and solid completion rates. Deliverable file generation quality, as inferred from self-QA and retries, appears acceptable but inconsistent, particularly in sectors requiring more formal or compliance-oriented outputs.",
    "failure_patterns": "Errors were present in 29 tasks, with Finance and Insurance and Retail Trade showing the lowest success rates. The 68 retried tasks indicate that initial responses frequently did not meet internal acceptance criteria, potentially due to formatting issues, incomplete deliverables, or insufficient adherence to elicitation prompts. Retries appear to have mitigated some failures but at the cost of increased latency. No single sector dominated error counts, suggesting cross-cutting issues related to prompt complexity or subprocess execution stability rather than domain-specific knowledge gaps.",
    "recommendations": "Refine prompt templates for sectors with lower success rates (e.g., Finance and Retail) to reduce ambiguity and improve first-pass task completion. Introduce stricter intermediate validation checks to catch common causes of retries earlier in the subprocess. Finally, evaluate latency drivers by profiling retries and long-running tasks, with the goal of reducing average execution time without sacrificing task completeness or self-assessed quality."
