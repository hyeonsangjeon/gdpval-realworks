## Execution Summary *(Self-Assessed, Pre-Grading)*

> **Note:** This summary is based on the LLM's self-assessed confidence scores (Self-QA) during task execution — not on external grading results. Actual grading scores from evaluators are not yet available at this stage.

This experiment executed the full 220-task GPT-5.2 Chat Elicit Capabilities suite in subprocess mode under the Elicit condition. The run achieved a 90.9% task completion rate, with 200 successful tasks and 20 errors. The model generated deliverables for the majority of tasks, with an average latency of approximately 24.8 seconds per task, indicating a relatively heavy execution footprint consistent with multi-step elicitation workflows.

Across completed tasks, the model reported an average self-assessed QA confidence of 5.87/10, with values spanning from low-confidence outputs (2/10) to high-confidence ones (9/10). These scores represent the model’s internal assessment of answer completeness and alignment with task instructions, not external evaluation. Key highlights include stable completion across most sectors and consistent deliverable generation, albeit with moderate confidence levels suggesting partial fulfillment or cautious self-evaluation rather than strong certainty.

Latency remained relatively uniform across sectors, with most averages falling in the 21–28 second range, suggesting that task complexity and elicitation depth had a greater influence on runtime than domain alone.

## Quality Analysis

Self-assessed QA scores clustered in the mid-range (5–6/10) across most sectors, indicating that the model generally believed it met core task requirements but often with omissions, uncertainty, or limited depth. Government and Real Estate tasks showed comparatively higher average confidence (6.9 and 6.3 respectively), suggesting clearer instructions or more structured outputs in those domains. Finance and Insurance exhibited the lowest average confidence (5.2/10), which may reflect higher precision requirements or more complex constraint handling.

Sector-to-sector variance in QA confidence was narrower than expected, implying that the elicitation framework produced broadly consistent output quality regardless of domain. Retail Trade tasks stood out with relatively higher confidence despite a lower success rate, suggesting that when tasks completed, the model felt reasonably aligned, but encountered more execution-level issues overall.

Deliverable file generation quality appeared generally sufficient for task completion, but the moderate self-QA scores imply that outputs may have lacked thoroughness, edge-case coverage, or strong justification. This pattern is consistent with elicitation tasks that require iterative reasoning or domain-specific rigor.

## Failure Analysis

The run recorded 20 errors and a relatively high retry count of 72 tasks, indicating intermittent instability during execution. Failures were not concentrated in a single sector, though Retail Trade and Wholesale Trade showed comparatively lower completion rates, suggesting susceptibility to task formulation or data-structure issues in those domains. Retries imply transient issues such as subprocess interruptions, timeouts, or partial outputs rather than systematic inability to perform the tasks.

## Recommendations

Reduce retry frequency by adjusting subprocess timeouts or introducing intermediate checkpoints for long-running elicitation tasks. This may help preserve partial progress and lower overall execution cost.

Refine elicitation prompts in lower-confidence sectors (notably Finance and Insurance) to clarify constraints, expected output structure, and completeness criteria, which may improve self-assessed QA confidence.

Segment the task suite by complexity or expected reasoning depth and apply adaptive latency or resource allocation, allowing simpler tasks to complete faster while reserving additional time for domains that consistently require longer processing.
