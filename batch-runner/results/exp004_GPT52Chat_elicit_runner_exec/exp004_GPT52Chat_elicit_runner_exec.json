It will include clearly labeled figures (hardness vs tempering time), tabulated summaries of the processed data, and engineering recommendations identifying effective treatment windows, with discussion grounded in accepted metallurgical domain knowledge.

The Terraform outputs include the fully qualified API Gateway endpoint URL for website integration.
