    "overview": "This experiment evaluated the GPT-5.2 Chat Baseline model running in subprocess execution mode across a full suite of 220 heterogeneous tasks spanning nine industry sectors. The primary focus was task completion behavior, self-assessed QA confidence scores generated by the model during execution, and latency characteristics under baseline conditions. No external grading or human evaluation was applied.\n\nOverall task completion was high, with 211 of 220 tasks completed successfully (95.9%). The model reported an average self-assessed QA confidence of 6.18/10, indicating moderate confidence in output quality across tasks, with observed variation depending on sector and task complexity. Average end-to-end latency was 28.4 seconds, with notable variance across sectors. Key highlights include perfect completion in multiple sectors and consistently mid-range self-evaluated quality rather than extreme confidence levels.",
    "quality_analysis": "Self-assessed QA confidence scores clustered between 5 and 7 for most sectors, suggesting that the model generally perceived its outputs as adequate but not highly polished. The highest average self-QA confidence appeared in Government (6.8/10) and Retail Trade (6.7/10), while Information and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services showed comparatively lower averages (5.6–5.7/10), potentially reflecting higher ambiguity or complexity in those task types.\n\nLatency patterns indicate that Information sector tasks were significantly slower on average (45.8 seconds) despite perfect completion, suggesting heavier reasoning, longer context handling, or more complex deliverable generation. Sectors with faster average latency generally aligned with slightly higher self-QA confidence, though the correlation was weak. Deliverable file generation quality, as implied by self-QA scores, was stable but not consistently high, indicating room for refinement in formatting, completeness, or specificity.",
    "failure_patterns": "Nine tasks resulted in errors, and 37 tasks required retries, indicating intermittent execution or robustness issues rather than systemic failure. Errors were distributed across sectors that otherwise showed high completion rates, suggesting task-specific edge cases, subprocess instability, or transient generation failures. The retry volume implies that while the model can often recover, initial execution reliability under baseline settings is not optimal.",
    "recommendations": "1. Investigate and profile high-latency sectors (notably Information) to determine whether prompt structure, context size, or tool invocation patterns are driving delays.\n2. Analyze error and retry logs at the task level to identify recurring failure modes and adjust execution safeguards or prompt constraints accordingly.\n3. Introduce targeted prompt or instruction refinements for sectors with lower self-assessed QA confidence to improve perceived output completeness and clarity without increasing latency."
