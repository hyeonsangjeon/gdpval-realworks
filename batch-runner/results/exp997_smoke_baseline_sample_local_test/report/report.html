  <!-- Execution Summary -->
  <section>
    <h2>Execution Summary (Self-Assessed)</h2>
    <p class="narrative" style="color:#888;font-size:0.85rem;margin-bottom:12px;">Based on LLM self-QA confidence scores · External grading scores not yet available</p>
    <div class="narrative"><p>The Smoke Baseline Run (Sample) experiment executed two tasks under the Baseline condition using the gpt-5.2-chat model in subprocess mode. All tasks completed successfully, yielding a 100% task completion rate with no execution errors or retries. The experiment served as a lightweight validation of end-to-end task handling, latency capture, and self-assessment reporting.</p><p>Based on the LLM’s self-assessed confidence during execution, overall task quality was high, with an average self-QA score of 8.5/10. Scores ranged narrowly between 8 and 9, suggesting consistent internal confidence across tasks. Average latency was 24.9 seconds, with noticeable variance between tasks, highlighting early signals about execution time sensitivity by sector rather than instability or failure.</p><p>Key highlights include clean task completion across both tested sectors and successful generation of expected deliverables without retries, indicating that the baseline configuration is functionally sound for small-scale validation runs.</p></div>
  </section>

  <!-- Quality Analysis -->
  <section>
    <h2>Quality Analysis</h2>
    <div class="narrative"><p>Self-QA scores indicate generally strong LLM-evaluated quality, with the Government sector task receiving a higher self-assessed confidence (9.0/10) than the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing task (8.0/10). This may reflect differences in task structure, prompt clarity, or domain familiarity rather than any correctness gap, as both tasks were completed without issue.</p><p>Latency showed a clear sector-level divergence: the Government task completed significantly faster (14.9s) than the Real Estate task (34.9s). This suggests that task complexity or output length in the Real Estate domain may be driving longer execution times. Despite this, there was no apparent degradation in self-assessed quality associated with higher latency.</p><p>Deliverable generation quality appears stable for this sample size, with no indications of partial outputs, truncation, or format issues reported. Given the limited scope, these results primarily validate baseline operability rather than robustness under varied or complex workloads.</p></div>
