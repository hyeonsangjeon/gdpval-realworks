The deliverable will be a professionally written Word document titled **“Performance_Improvement_Plan_John_Miller_2025-07-13.docx.”**  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe document will clearly document observed performance deficiencies, tie them to objective data from the Work Order Log and Resident Complaint Log, and outline a fair, structured plan for improvement in line with company standards and HR best practices.\n\n**Contents:**  \n1. **Summary of Performance Gaps** – Quantitative analysis of key metrics (acknowledgement/completion timeliness, redo rate, and work order handling) derived from the Work Order Log, along with qualitative themes from resident complaints (communication, professionalism, and work quality).  \n2. **Performance Objectives (3–5)** – Specific, measurable, and time-bound goals aligned with company standards (e.g., 72-hour completion, redo rate below 5%).  \n3. **Support and Resources** – Assigned training modules (Customer Service & Professionalism, Advanced Plumbing Diagnostics, HVAC Fundamentals) with justification and completion timelines within the first 30 days.  \n4. **Consequences Statement** – Clear explanation of potential next steps if improvement benchmarks are not met by the end of the 90-day PIP period.  \n5. **Signatures** – Standard acknowledgement section for Management, Employee, and Witness.\n\n**File Format:**  \n- Microsoft Word document (.docx), approximately 2–3 pages, suitable for HR records and in-person review meetings.\n\nBelow is the complete Python code that reads the provided reference files, analyzes the data, and generates the finalized PIP document in the current directory.",

The analysis column will explicitly flag each award as either “Fast Spending” or “Slow Spending.” This structured output will allow program and grants management staff to efficiently identify recipients requiring follow-up to ensure spending aligns with federal requirements.",
