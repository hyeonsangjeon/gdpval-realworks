  "narrative": {
    "overview": "This experiment evaluated the GPT-5.2 Chat model under a Lightweight Elicit configuration with a 16k token context, executed via subprocess across 220 tasks. The run achieved a high task completion rate of 92.3% (203/220), with 17 tasks ending in errors and a relatively high retry count of 47, indicating intermittent instability rather than systemic failure. Average end-to-end latency was 23.0 seconds, consistent with a long-context, multi-task workload.\n\nAcross completed tasks, the model reported an average self-assessed QA confidence of 6.17/10, with a wide range (2–9). These scores represent the model’s own evaluation of response completeness and correctness at generation time, not external grading. Overall, the results suggest reliable task completion with moderate confidence levels, and some variability by sector and task type.",
    "quality_analysis": "Self-assessed QA confidence clustered primarily in the mid-range (5–7), suggesting that the model often judged its outputs as adequate but not strongly confident. Higher average confidence was observed in Government (7.2/10) and Retail Trade (6.9/10), which may reflect more structured or policy-oriented tasks with clearer constraints. Lower averages in Information (5.8/10) and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (5.7/10) suggest challenges with open-ended or technically nuanced prompts.\n\nLatency varied meaningfully by sector. Information tasks exhibited notably higher average latency (38.1s) while maintaining full task completion, implying heavier reasoning or longer outputs rather than execution failures. Manufacturing and Finance showed slightly reduced success rates (84–88%), potentially indicating sensitivity to domain-specific constraints or formatting requirements. Deliverable file generation quality was generally sufficient to pass completion checks, but the mid-range self-QA scores indicate that outputs may have required cautious self-evaluation due to ambiguity, partial coverage, or verbosity concerns.",
    "failure_patterns": "Failures were limited in number (17) but accompanied by a relatively high retry count (47), suggesting transient execution issues such as timeouts, partial generations, or tool/subprocess interruptions rather than consistent prompt misunderstanding. Sectors with lower success rates, such as Manufacturing and Retail Trade, likely contributed disproportionately to retries, indicating that certain task schemas or data structures were more brittle under this configuration.",
    "recommendations": "Reduce retry frequency by tightening timeout handling and subprocess recovery logic, particularly for sectors with lower success rates. Consider prompt or schema refinements for Manufacturing and Information tasks to reduce ambiguity and improve self-assessed confidence. Finally, evaluate whether selective context-length reduction or response length constraints could lower latency in high-delay sectors without materially impacting task completion."
