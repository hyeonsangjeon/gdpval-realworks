First, I will create an Excel workbook (Illinois_Well_Screening.xlsx) with two tabs: (1) “All_Wells,” structured with the requested columns, filters for depth, aquifer type, and status, and a boolean field indicating whether each well meets all screening criteria; and (2) “Candidate_Wells,” containing only wells that meet the criteria. Due to the lack of internet access in this environment, no Illinois EPA data could be programmatically retrieved, so the workbook is provided as a ready-to-use screening template with correct structure and logic. Second, I will generate a brief professional email (Well_Screening_Email.docx) to management summarizing the approach, noting the data-access limitation, and explaining how the attached Excel file should be populated and used once the Illinois EPA Source Water Assessment factsheets are reviewed.\n\nCONFIDENCE[60]",
