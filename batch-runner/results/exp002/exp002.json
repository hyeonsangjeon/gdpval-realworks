It translates WCAG concepts into clear editorial actions covering text, images, graphics, audio, video, headlines, links, and basic page structure. It includes guidance on when to escalate questions to section editors, notes where CMS or tooling changes are being handled by the dev team, and confirms that formal training will be announced in the Slack editorial advice channel. A bibliography with clickable links supports further learning.\n\n2. **Editorial Accessibility Quick Checklist (PDF)**  \n   This is a concise, printable checklist for everyday use before publishing content. It focuses on high‑impact, non‑technical checks (headings, links, alt text, captions, colour contrast awareness, video/audio requirements, and inclusive language). The checklist is designed to reduce legal and reputational risk while being fast to use under deadline pressure.\n\n3. **Accessibility Knowledge Quiz for Editorial Staff (PDF)**  \n   This multiple‑choice quiz assesses understanding of the guide and checklist. It includes scenario‑based questions relevant to news production, four options per question, one correct answer each, plus a full answer key with explanations and a scoring guide. The quiz is suitable for onboarding, refresher training, and compliance tracking.\n\nAll files are generated as **PDFs** for consistent distribution and long‑term use in onboarding and review processes.\n\n---",

It maps each script line to visuals (California landmarks, workers, renewable energy), notes where graphic cards replace footage, and explains music and VO usage.\n\n2. **Stock Footage & Music Log (Support_Green_Energy_Stock_Log.xlsx)**  \n   A professional media log listing placeholder stock footage and music selections with:\n   - Clip description and intended usage\n   - Stock platform (e.g., Adobe Stock, Pond5, Shutterstock)\n   - Direct preview URLs (for review only)\n   - Estimated duration in the cut  \n   This allows the client to license the exact assets after approval.\n\n3. **Graphic Cards (PNG stills, 1920×1080)**  \n   - `Graphic_Renewable_Reliable_Green_Energy.png`  \n   - `Graphic_Urge_Your_Legislator.png`  \n   Clean black backgrounds with white, centered type (Arial-style), matching the two scripted moments that call for graphics instead of imagery. These are broadcast‑safe design references.\n\n4. **Storyboard Slides (Support_Green_Energy_Storyboard.pptx)**  \n   A visual storyboard with one slide per major beat of the commercial, including:\n   - Script/VO text\n   - Visual intent notes\n   - Graphic card callouts  \n   This mirrors how agencies typically review a spot before final edit.\n\n5. **Scratch VO Script (Support_Green_Energy_Scratch_VO.txt)**  \n   A clean, read‑through script formatted for recording a temporary scratch voiceover to validate timing and pacing.\n\nThese materials together function as a **ready‑to‑edit blueprint**. Once approved, they can be dropped directly into an NLE to produce the final 1920×1080, 30‑second H.264 broadcast master with licensed media and professional VO.\n\n---",

The document follows a standard policy structure and includes sections for purpose, scope, policy statement, definitions, responsibilities, procedures, timelines, evaluation criteria, and records retention. It clearly identifies eligibility to submit training requests, required documentation, review and evaluation steps, and final approval authority. The policy explicitly requires review and approval by the Ethics Liaison Officer, Chief, Division of Parole, Chief, Fiscal Services Unit, and Chairman. It also provides guidance on compliance with state training mandates and internal accountability requirements.\n\n2. **Training Request and Training Log Template (Excel spreadsheet, .xlsx)**  \n   This spreadsheet serves as the official logging and tracking mechanism referenced in the general order. It includes structured worksheets for (a) tracking training requests from submission through final approval, (b) documenting required approvals and signatures, and (c) recording officer participation, completion dates, and records retention information. The spreadsheet supports consistent documentation, audit readiness, and long-term maintenance of training records.\n\nTogether, these files provide both the policy framework and the practical tools needed to implement and manage the training request process consistently across the agency.",

Its purpose is to explain, at a high level, why and how an 8‑year Roth conversion strategy can benefit the client. The presentation will:\n- Explain the purpose of Roth conversions and why they are particularly valuable given the client’s large pre‑tax 401(k) balance.\n- Describe what makes a suitable Roth conversion candidate.\n- Outline the step‑by‑step process of implementing an 8‑year conversion strategy beginning at retirement.\n- Highlight the advantages of tax‑free growth, reduced future RMDs, and tax‑free inheritance for heirs.\nThe slides will use a clean, professional business style consistent with a “digital tunnel” aesthetic and will be saved in PowerPoint (.pptx) format.\n\n**Deliverable 2: Roth_Conversion_Analysis_2025_2054.xlsx**  \nThis Excel spreadsheet provides a detailed, year‑by‑year quantitative comparison between:\n- A baseline scenario using Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) only, and  \n- An 8‑year Roth conversion strategy.\n\nThe spreadsheet will:\n- Model years 2025 (Period 0) through 2054 (Period 29).\n- Show annual Roth conversion amounts over the first 8 years, estimated taxes on conversions, and projected account growth at an assumed 8% annual return.\n- Track Traditional IRA and Roth IRA balances over time.\n- Calculate RMDs beginning at age 72 using IRS Uniform Lifetime Table factors and estimate taxes due in both scenarios.\n- Quantify projected tax savings and emphasize long‑term benefits for retirement income and estate planning, particularly the growth of tax‑free assets for heirs.\nThe file will be saved in Excel (.xlsx) format and structured so assumptions and outcomes are easy to review during a client meeting.\n\nBelow is the complete Python code that generates both deliverables.",

The deliverable will be an Excel workbook titled **“Suite_330_Rent_Scenarios.xlsx.”**  \n\n**Purpose:**  \nThis file will allow the prospective tenant (and ownership) to clearly understand how rent escalates over time under three different lease-term scenarios and to evaluate total lease value on both an annualized and monthly basis. The workbook will function as a calculator, enabling easy modification of key assumptions without breaking the underlying logic.\n\n**Contents & Structure:**  \n- **Editable Property Variables:**  \n  - Suite Number  \n  - Rentable Square Footage  \n  These inputs will be clearly marked in light blue and referenced throughout the workbook.\n\n- **Scenario Inputs (3 Scenarios):**  \n  For each scenario, users can modify:  \n  - Primary Term (years)  \n  - Base Rent ($/SF/month)  \n  - Annual Escalator (%)  \n  Each scenario will be color-coded consistently across all matrices.\n\n- **Annual Rent Matrix:**  \n  - Displays Year #, Monthly Rent, $/SF, and Annual Base Rent  \n  - Automatically escalates rent on each lease anniversary  \n  - Shows totals up to 10 years where applicable  \n  - Calculates and displays Total Gross Lease Value per scenario  \n  - Includes a Notes section for assumptions and clarifications  \n\n- **Monthly Rent Matrix:**  \n  - Displays rent by individual month (up to 120 months for a 10-year term)  \n  - Uses conditional logic so unused months remain blank for shorter terms  \n  - Clearly shows when rent increases occur  \n  - Displays Total Lease Value prominently at the top  \n  - Monthly totals reconcile exactly to the Annual Rent Matrix  \n\n**File Format:**  \n- Microsoft Excel (.xlsx), fully formula-driven, no external links or macros  \n\nThis deliverable will provide a transparent, easy-to-follow comparison of lease structures and support informed decision-making for both tenant and ownership.\n\n---",
