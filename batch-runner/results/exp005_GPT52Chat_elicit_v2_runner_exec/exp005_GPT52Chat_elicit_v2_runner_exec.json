Second, I will produce a concise training presentation titled “Promo Projection Form.pptx” (under 8 slides) that explains what the form is, why it is being used, where stores will find it on SharePoint, what sections Meat Team Leaders must complete, and how the end-to-end process works, including a visual sample of the form filled with mock data.

I will also include a minimal but sufficient `package.json` to install dependencies and run tests, and a `README.md` explaining usage, props, accessibility behavior, and test execution.\n\nCONFIDENCE[87]",
