  "narrative": {
    "overview": "This experiment executed the GPT-5.2 Chat Elicit v2 configuration across 220 tasks using a subprocess execution mode. The primary objective was to observe task completion behavior, self-assessed QA confidence, latency characteristics, and sector-level variation under the Elicit v2 condition. Out of 220 tasks, 199 completed successfully, yielding a 90.5% task completion rate, with 21 tasks resulting in errors and 59 requiring at least one retry.\n\nThe model reported an average self-assessed QA confidence of 6.16/10, with a wide range (2–9), indicating variable confidence depending on task type and sector. Latency was consistently high, averaging approximately 25.4 seconds per task, suggesting substantial reasoning or context-handling overhead in this configuration. Overall, the run demonstrates stable completion with moderate self-evaluated quality and predictable latency costs.",
    "quality_analysis": "Self-assessed QA scores clustered in the mid-range (5–7) across most sectors, with Government tasks standing out for higher average confidence (7.2/10). Information-sector tasks achieved perfect completion but had the lowest average self-assessed QA confidence (5.1/10), suggesting that while tasks were completed reliably, the model expressed lower confidence in output quality or completeness.\n\nFinance, Manufacturing, and Professional/Scientific/Technical Services showed similar QA profiles around 6.0–6.1, indicating consistent but unexceptional self-evaluated quality. Retail Trade had a slightly higher average QA confidence (6.6) with lower latency than most sectors, whereas Manufacturing and Information tasks exhibited some of the highest average latencies, implying greater complexity or prompt length affecting response time.",
    "failure_patterns": "The 21 errors and 59 retried tasks indicate intermittent execution instability rather than systemic failure. Retries were relatively high compared to total errors, suggesting transient issues such as subprocess timeouts, context overload, or response formatting problems rather than persistent task incompatibility. Sectors with lower success counts (e.g., Wholesale Trade and Finance) may involve prompts that are more sensitive to such execution constraints.",
    "recommendations": "1. Investigate high-latency sectors (Information, Manufacturing) to determine whether prompt length, instruction complexity, or output formatting requirements can be optimized to reduce execution time.\n2. Analyze retried tasks to identify common prompt structures or subprocess conditions that trigger retries, and adjust execution parameters or prompt templates accordingly.\n3. Consider targeted prompt refinement in sectors with lower self-assessed QA confidence to improve clarity and reduce model uncertainty while maintaining the current task completion rate."
