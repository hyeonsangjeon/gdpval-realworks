## [Unreleased]

### Added (grading-v2 PR1 — score-math sign-bug fix, headline numbers now trustworthy)
- **`ItemGrade.model_did_right`** — sign-aware right-outcome flag computed in `core.grader.Grader._aggregate`. For positive `max_score` items right = `verdict == "pass"`; for negative penalty items right = `verdict != "pass"` (i.e. the bad thing did NOT happen). `judge_error` is conservatively right=False. Resolves the systemic bug where every `verdict == "pass"` filter mixed semantically opposite signals for positive and negative rubric items.
- **`MAGNITUDE_THRESHOLD = 4` + `_is_critical_item()`** in `core/grader.py` and `summary.wow.critical_item_pass_rate` recomputed in `step8_grade._compute_summary` to use sign-aware `model_did_right`. Critical set grows from 397 (legacy `score >= 3` rule, positive only) to 483 items (now correctly including 86 negative-magnitude penalty items the legacy rule discarded). Documents rationale for `required` field being dead (null across all observed GDPVal rubrics).
- **`TaskRubric.max_score` = positive-only sum** + **`TaskGrade.pct_raw`** un-clamped diagnostic field. Fixes 4 exp003 tasks where v1's arithmetic positive+negative sum produced `total_max <= 0`, collapsing pct into mathematically undefined values that the `[0,100]` clamp silently masked (e.g. `6074bba3` v1 reported 65.76% on `total_max=-330`; v2sm reports 0.0% with `pct_raw=-434.00`).
- **`scripts/backfill_sign_aware.py`** + **4 new `*__v2sm.json` files on main** (`data/grades/exp003_*__v2sm.json` × 2, `data/grades/exp998_smoke_*__v2sm.json` × 2). v1 files preserved untouched (back-fill policy (c) from `tasks/rebuilding_grading_task/000-OVERVIEW.md`).
- **`schema_version` enum bumped to `["1.0", "1.1"]`** in `batch-runner/schemas/grade.schema.json`. v1.1 = v1.0 superset (`model_did_right`, `pct_raw` optional). `scripts/aggregate-grades.mjs` routes both versions through `processV1GradesFile`.
- **15 new tests** across `batch-runner/tests/test_grader.py` (sign × verdict normalization, magnitude threshold, sign-aware `critical_fail`, positive-only denominator, `pct_raw` diagnostics) and `scripts/__tests__/test_backfill_sign_aware.py` (6 backfill scenarios). Full regression: **478 batch-runner pytest + 29 scripts pytest + node mjs** all green.

#### Headline diff (exp003 219/220 graded)
| metric | hybrid v1 | hybrid v2sm | mini v1 | mini v2sm |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| critical_item_pass_rate | 0.421 | 0.466 | 0.518 | 0.596 |
| avg_score_pct | 49.25 | 48.18 | 51.47 | 50.97 |

The wider hybrid-vs-mini critical gap on v2sm (−0.130 vs v1 −0.097) reflects inclusion of 94 previously-excluded negative-magnitude penalty items. STRATIFY_v2 bucket decomposition (formatting 60.3% / penalty 21.8% / content 17.9% of hybrid-stricter pairs) remains the authoritative driver-of-the-gap read. Full PR1 details: [tasks/rebuilding_grading_task/PR1_REPORT.md](tasks/rebuilding_grading_task/PR1_REPORT.md).

PR2 (tool-calling grader rewrite) and PR3 (validation gates) tracked in `tasks/rebuilding_grading_task/` and will land in subsequent sessions.

### Added (autonomous validation + full follow-up chain)
- **`scripts/compare_grades.py`** — pair-wise critical-item comparison over the intersection of `task_id`s between two grade JSONs. Emits markdown report + decision JSON. Autonomous decision rule: `hybrid_critical_pass / mini_critical_pass >= 0.7` → PROCEED, otherwise → ABORT. Used both for fast 12-task C′ pre-validation and for the full 220-task post-run head-to-head.
- **`scripts/analyze_grade_run.py`** — extracts wall-clock, judge latency p50/p95, total tokens, price-table-based cost estimate (`PRICING_USD_PER_M_TOKENS`), top-5 slowest tasks, and optional Δ vs baseline grade. Auto-invoked by `grade-run.yml` on rc=0 chunks; produces `<grade>.analysis.md` alongside the grade JSON.
- **`.github/workflows/validate-hybrid-and-decide.yml`** — single-job C′ validation: grades the same first-N tasks with mini default, runs `compare_grades.py`, commits comparison + decision, and on PROCEED auto-dispatches the hybrid full run. `pair_limit` default 12, `timeout-minutes: 150` (sized for exp003's ~3-4 min/task on mini default).
- **`grade-run.yml` auto follow-up steps (rc=0 only):**
  - hybrid full done → auto-dispatch mini default full run for the same experiment (skipped if mini grade ≥200 tasks already exists)
  - mini default full done + hybrid full present → run `compare_grades.py` over the full 220-task pair, commit `DECISION_FULL.json` + `COMPARE_FULL.md` to `data/grades/_validation/`
- **`scripts/__tests__/` (11 new tests)** — `test_compare_grades.py` (6 tests: PROCEED/ABORT at threshold boundary, task_id intersection, mini critical_pass=0 guard) and `test_analyze_grade_run.py` (5 tests: single vs routing cost mode, wall-clock from `graded_at` span, top5 ordering, markdown sections).

### Added (chunked auto-resume for long grade runs)
- **`step8_grade.py` --resume flag + 4h time guard.** Reads existing partial grade JSON at the templated output path, harvests already-completed `task_id`s, skips them, and continues. Time budget is `GRADER_TIME_BUDGET_SEC` env (default 14400s/4h); when tripped before all tasks are graded, step8 partial-saves and exits 7. Distinct from existing `--force` semantics (mutually exclusive).
- **`grade-run.yml` self-retriggering chunk pattern.** Job `timeout-minutes: 320` (5h20m, safely under GH Actions' 6h hard limit), `permissions.actions: write`, new `resume`/`resume_chunk` inputs. When step8 returns 7, commits the partial then dispatches the next chunk via `gh workflow run` (uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no PAT). Safety cap: `resume_chunk > 10` aborts. Enables 220-task hybrid/pro_only runs that exceed the single-job 6h limit.
- **`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`** on the grading step so per-task progress streams live in the GH Actions log instead of buffering for minutes.

### Fixed
- **`gpt-5.4-mini` rejects `reasoning_effort='minimal'` (Azure HTTP 400).** Valid values are `none/low/medium/high/xhigh`. `core/grader.py` tier_mini default and `validation_hybrid.yaml` both updated to `'low'`; `_sweep_template.yaml` doc comments updated to document the constraint. Root cause of a 6.6h wasted hybrid run that produced only 20/220 graded tasks before this was found.
- **`pct` clamped to `[0, 100]` in `core/grader.py`** to honor `grade.schema.json` `{minimum: 0, maximum: 100}`. Two exp003 tasks (#44 pct=108.9%, #45 pct=229.3%) were violating the schema, causing partial-save validation to silently fail at task #50. `step8_grade.py` partial-save block now also wrapped in try/except with full traceback so future schema violations surface immediately.
- **`pytest -q` collection unbroken from `batch-runner/`.** Two legacy test files (`test_main.py`, `test_main_hf_integration.py`) imported the removed pre-pipeline monolith `main.py` at module top and crashed collection; wrapped with `pytest.importorskip('main')` so they cleanly skip. `test_data_loader.py::test_load_raises_error_when_no_snapshot_and_no_auto_download` asserted the old `download()` substring in the error message; loosened to accept either `step0_bootstrap.sh` (current) or `download()`. Result: 465 passed / 2 skipped / 0 failed (was 37 deselected + 2 errors).

### Tested (decision: keep single-mini default; reject tiered hypothesis)
- **Tiered grading hypothesis rejected on exp003 head-to-head.** Re-tested the ORIGINAL `TASK_GRADE_COST_OPTIMIZATION.md` proposal (pro for weight≥4 critical items, mini for rest) against the sweep-selected single-mini default on 40 tasks of `exp003_GPT52Chat_baseline_runner_exec`. Tiered LOST on all axes:
  - critical_item_pass_rate: single-mini **0.55** vs tiered **0.43** (tiered worse, opposite of intent)
  - avg_score_pct: 47.26 vs 45.61 (tiered −1.65pp)
  - judge_total_latency: 6,002s vs **14,845s** (tiered 2.5× slower)
  - cost (40 tasks): ~$1.7 vs **~$25** (tiered ~15× more expensive)
  - Hypothesis: gpt-5.4-pro with reasoning_effort=high becomes MORE strict on borderline criteria, depressing critical_pass instead of raising it. Confirms the Sweep Phase A pattern (A1_pro_high < A2_std_extract_1500 by ~5pp).
- `tiered_critical_pro_mini.yaml` remains in `batch-runner/grading_configs/` for future re-experimentation (e.g., weight≥5 critical, or pro at medium effort), but is NOT promoted to default.
- Full analysis: `tasks/0525_monday/COMPARISON_REPORT.md`.

### Known issues
- **`step8_grade.py` exits 1 after task #50** when grading exp003 — discovered during the tiered validation. Both runs (single-mini and tiered) failed at the exact same task #50 / `d025a41c` boundary, no Python traceback, ~2.5h elapsed in mini run / ~4h in tiered. Likely memory accumulation or task #51 entry crash. Cost optimization is unaffected; bug tracked in `tasks/0525_monday/TASK_STEP8_TASK50_FAIL.md`. **Root cause found and fixed above** (pct schema violation + silent partial-save failure).

### Changed
- **`batch-runner/grading_configs/default_gpt5pro.yaml` now uses `gpt-5.4-mini` at medium reasoning effort (was `gpt-5.4-pro` high).** Promoted from `recommended_gpt5_4_mini_2026-05-24.yaml` after Stage 1 validation re-graded `exp998_smoke_baseline_sample` against the prior baseline grade. Validation results (head-to-head, same inference, same rubric, same prompt, same precheck):
  - avg_score_pct: 77.83 → **78.03** (+0.20pp, well within ±2pp acceptance)
  - critical_item_pass_rate: 1.00 → 1.00 (preserved)
  - judge_error_rate: **5.9% → 0.0%**
  - precheck_pass_rate: 0.80 → 0.80 (unchanged)
  - judge_total_latency_sec: 8530 → **265** (32× faster)
  - input/output tokens: −23% / −60%
  - Projected full-run cost (220 tasks, linear extrapolation): **$493 → $18** (−96.3%). Monthly capacity at $2,500 tenant cap: **~5 → ~135 runs**.
- Filename `default_gpt5pro.yaml` preserved so existing `grade-run.yml` triggers, dashboard aggregators, and downstream tooling continue to work. `config_name` field updated to `default_gpt5pro`.
- Prior config preserved as `batch-runner/grading_configs/recommended_gpt5_4_mini_2026-05-24.yaml` (identical content; kept for documentation / future renames).
- Rollback path: `git revert <this commit>` reverts to the gpt-5.4-pro high default. Recommended config remains available for explicit `--grading_config recommended_gpt5_4_mini_2026-05-24.yaml` invocation.

### Added
- **Grading cost optimization sweep — winner `A4_model_mini` (-96.3% cost).** Autonomous sweep (27 variants across Phase A axis-sweeps / Phase B tier-combinations / Phase C stability + 1 gpt-4o diversity check) selected `gpt-5.4-mini` at medium reasoning effort, no batching, deliverable extract 1500 chars as the new default grading judge. Full-run cost projection drops from $493 (baseline `default_gpt5pro.yaml`) to **$18.45** (-96.3%) at avg_score_pct **+0.08pp**, critical_item_pass_rate **1.00** preserved, judge_error_rate **0.0%** (baseline 5.9%). Smoke wall-clock 299s vs 142min (28× faster). Monthly capacity at $2,500 tenant cap: ~135 runs vs ~5 prior. Total sweep spend $42.36 / $80 cap across 4 GH Actions runs (12.6 hours wall-clock). Drop-in config: `tasks/0523_saturday/cost_opt_results/2026-05-24-grade-cost-sweep/winner_config.yaml`. Full analysis: `tasks/0523_saturday/cost_opt_results/2026-05-24-grade-cost-sweep/FINAL_REPORT.md`. Key insights: (a) gpt-5.4-pro is unusable below medium reasoning (verdict JSON parse fails 100%); (b) tier combinations consistently underperform single-mini (verdict fragmentation); (c) batching loses 3.6pp score per 3× call reduction; (d) gpt-4o diversity validator unfunctional with Responses-API reasoning shape. Caveats: winner has only 1 measurement (Phase C only stresses Phase B variants), pricing is approximate. Promotion path: manual full-run validation → replace default_gpt5pro.yaml.
- **`.github/workflows/grade-cost-sweep.yml` — autonomous sweep dispatcher CI.** New workflow runs `scripts/grading_cost_sweep.py` end-to-end on GH Actions. `source_ref` input separates OIDC subject (must be a federated ref, typically `main`) from the code branch to checkout (the feat branch with sweep dispatcher). 350-min timeout. Federated OIDC via `azure/login@v2` (no API key, no secret rotation needed). Commits `RESULTS.md` / `progress.json` back to source_ref; uploads grade JSON + run.log artifacts for 30 days. Workflow itself lives on `main`; sweep code lives on the feat branch.
- **`fix(grader)`: API key fallback for sweep environments without working OIDC** (opt-in via `GRADER_ALLOW_API_KEY_FALLBACK=1` env). Production CI keeps OIDC-only behavior by default. Documented in module docstring.
- **`fix(sweep)`: subprocess env injection from `batch-runner/.env`**. step8_grade and core/* read only from `os.environ` and do not call `load_dotenv`; the dispatcher now hydrates the subprocess env so local execution does not silently lose `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
- **`fix(sweep)`: variant outputs isolated to per-variant `runs/<name>/` dir**. Previously variant configs left `output.directory` at the template default `../data/grades`, causing every variant to overwrite production grade JSONs (caught via `git diff` before any data was lost). `render_temp_config()` now sets `output.directory` to an absolute per-variant path; `run_step8_grade()` uses `shutil.copy2` instead of `shutil.move` so the templated original survives for audit.
- **TASK_GRADE_COST_SWEEP Track 1 — prompt-level batching + tiered judge routing.** New `batch-runner/core/grader_batch.py` (`BatchJudge`) evaluates N rubric items per Azure OpenAI Responses API call with per-item evidence enforcement and one-level `chunk_size // 2` fallback on parse failure. New sibling prompt `batch-runner/prompts/grader_judge_batch.md` (legacy `grader_judge.md` preserved byte-identical). `batch-runner/core/grader.py` accepts two new OPTIONAL config keys: `grader.batch_size` (int, default 1) and `judge_routing` (tier_pro / tier_standard / tier_mini); when either is set, judge items are routed by tier and dispatched in batches, and `judge_call_count` switches from per-item to per-API-call semantics. New reference config `batch-runner/grading_configs/_sweep_template.yaml` shows the v1.0 schema plus the new optional knobs. 14 mocked unit tests (`tests/test_grader_batch.py` + `tests/test_grader_routing.py`).
- **TASK_GRADE_COST_SWEEP Track 2 — autonomous sweep dispatcher.** `scripts/grading_cost_sweep.py` (executable, OIDC-only) drives the cost-optimization sweep end-to-end: loads `tasks/0523_saturday/grading_cost_sweep_plan.yaml` (15 Phase A + 5 Phase B variants + Phase C stability spec + gpt-4o diversity validator), validates each variant against a hard-coded `MODEL_TPM` table at 70% cap, renders per-variant configs on top of `_sweep_template.yaml`, subprocesses `step8_grade.py` per variant, extracts metrics, runs Pareto selection under acceptance hard filter (critical=1.0, err≤5%, score±2pp), and emits `RESULTS.md` + `summary.json` + `winner_config.yaml`. Cost cap $80 enforced; `progress.json` supports `--resume`. 12 mocked tests at `scripts/__tests__/test_grading_cost_sweep.py`. Operator guide at `tasks/0523_saturday/cost_opt_results/README.md`.
- Grade source linkage (Phase 2). `step8_grade.py` now embeds two new fields on every emitted grade JSON: `source_inference_experiment_id` (defaults to `experiment_yaml_name`; overridable via new `--source-experiment-id` CLI flag) and `source_inference_run_dir` (repo-relative path, null when unknown). `scripts/aggregate-grades.mjs` resolver looks up `taskQaByExperiment` by the source pointer first, falling back to `experiment_id` (Phase 1 behavior preserved). Schema `batch-runner/schemas/grade.schema.json` adds both fields as optional/nullable — legacy v1 grades without them still validate. Backfilled `data/grades/exp998_smoke_baseline_sample__*.json` to point at `exp999_smoke_baseline_sample`, restoring 3/3 calibration matching (MAE=10.65, unmatched=0). Spec: `tasks/0523_saturday/TASK_GRADE_SOURCE_LINKAGE_BACKEND.md`.
- `tasks/0523_saturday/TASK_GRADE_COST_OPTIMIZATION.md` — judge 채점 비용/시간 압축 계획 (smoke 142m → 30m, 풀런 ~$540 → ≤$120). reasoning_effort, precheck 확장, item batching, tiered judge routing(mini=extended precheck / standard=gpt-5.5 / pro=critical only), concurrency 상향의 단계별 실행안.
- `tasks/0523_saturday/TASK_GRADE_COST_SWEEP.md` — 자율 dispatch sweep 사양. `scripts/grading_cost_sweep.py`가 16+5+6+1=28개 변종(Phase A 단축/Phase B 조합/Phase C 안정성/diversity)을 Global Standard API + prompt-level batching으로 실행하여 정확도 제약(critical=1.0, err≤5%, score±2pp) 내 Pareto 우승자를 자동 도출하고 `RESULTS.md` + `winner_config.yaml`을 생성. 사용 모델은 endpoint 가용 5.4 family(pro/std/mini/nano) + gpt-4o(diversity only). cost_cap_usd $80 강제.
- Grade detail page: Self-QA vs Rubric calibration view (Phase 1). Three new columns (Self-QA, Δ Gap, Calibration), three new filters (Calibrated/Overconfident/Underconfident), Calibration MAE pill in Health Strip, and footer match-rate note. Build-time join via `aggregate-reports.mjs` enriching reports-index with compact `task_qa` map; `aggregate-grades.mjs` performs strict per-experiment lookup (no global task_id map). Dummy grades and unmatched experiments are explicitly handled. Spec: `tasks/0523_saturday/TASK_GRADE_DETAIL_SELF_QA_CALIBRATION.md`. Follow-up: `TASK_GRADE_SOURCE_LINKAGE_BACKEND.md`.

## [2026-05-23] — Phase A wow follow-up: dashboard cleanup + grading hotfix

### Added

- **Dashboard cleanup spec package + WOW chrome cleanup (PR #1 of
  `tasks/dashboard_cleanup`).** Threaded `inference_model` vs
  `judge_model` as separate fields end-to-end so the GradeDetail header
  no longer misleads users into thinking the judge model solved the
  tasks. Aggregator (`scripts/aggregate-grades.mjs`) gained:
  - `grade_status: 'graded_v1' | 'legacy_dummy' | 'no_grade'` derived
    from `schema_version` / `_meta.is_dummy`.
  - `experiment_id` lifted to a top-level field (no more brittle
    `startsWith` matching across the dashboard).
  - `inference_model` / `judge_model` split — the legacy `model` falsy
    fallback to `judge.model` was removed.
  - Unit tests under `scripts/__tests__/aggregate-grades.test.mjs`
    locking the no-fallback contract + status derivation (3 fixtures).
  Frontend additions: `src/types/grade.ts` (already shipped in PR #46;
  unchanged here), `src/lib/format.ts` (`fmtPct` / `fmtLatency`),
  `src/components/wow/HealthStrip.tsx` (single-Card inline pill strip
  showing `judge_error_rate`, `judge_pass_rate`, `precheck_pass_rate`,
  `total_judge_calls`, `total_judge_latency_sec`; err pill turns red
  + `AlertTriangle` when `judge_error_rate > 5%`). Copy pass 2 across
  `src/data/tooltipTexts.ts` + `src/components/ScopeBadge.tsx`
  separates "self-QA" (model judging itself during inference) from
  "LLM-judge grade" (rubric-based, run via `grade-run.yml`) on every
  surface — KPI tiles, leaderboard tooltips, About modal bullets,
  empty-state CTAs.

- **`tasks/dashboard_cleanup/` 8-file spec package.** README + 000
  overview + 001 (model display) + 002 (banner/status) + 003 (health)
  + 004 (disagreement guard) + 005 (copy pass 2) + 006 (rollout) +
  copy_audit.md. Amended in-place after extreme-reasoner +
  ui-designer deep review (precedence rules, opacity → dashed border,
  amber → zinc, hard-gate aggregator tests, mandatory grep audit).

### Changed

- **`legacy_dummy` cards on the Grading tab now use `border-dashed`
  with a neutral `DEMO` badge** (BookOpen icon, zinc palette) instead
  of `opacity-90` (WCAG AA contrast fix) and instead of the previous
  amber `⏳ Awaiting LLM-Judge Grade` strip (which misleadingly fired
  even when v1.0 grades were present). The `⏳ Awaiting` strip is
  removed from per-card chrome.

- **Grading Analysis tab top banner is now status-aware.** When only
  legacy demo grades exist, the banner uses a neutral zinc tone with
  a `BookOpen` icon and points to `grade-run.yml`. When legacy +
  graded-v1 are mixed, the banner switches to a soft sky tone with an
  `Info` icon clarifying that some experiments still show demo data
  alongside fresh LLM-judge results. Amber is no longer used in this
  surface; it remains reserved for `self_assessed_pre_grading` (a
  true "awaiting" state on the experiment side).

- **`ScopeBadge` union extended.** `'graded_v1'` (fuchsia, Sparkles
  icon — "✨ LLM-Judge Graded (v1.0)") and `'legacy_demo'` (zinc,
  BookOpen — "📚 Legacy Demo") added; pre-existing `'graded'` and
  `'self_assessed_pre_grading'` variants preserved. `ExperimentDetail`
  now derives scope via `resolveScope(meta, grades)`: grade-derived
  status wins when an exact `experiment_id` match exists, otherwise
  meta is used as fallback.

- **`Grader Disagreement` UI is guarded.** Both the cross-experiment
  chart in `GradingAnalysisView` and the per-card `Disagreement`
  StatMini in `GradesSummary` now render only when
  `inconsistent_grades > 0` (i.e., Phase B multi-judge runs). The
  underlying counter logic is retained for Phase B.

- **CHANGELOG entries are now grouped under dated release headings
  (`## [YYYY-MM-DD]`)** instead of a single open-ended `## [Unreleased]`
  block. The previous entries have been bundled into a single
  retroactive `## [2026-05-20]` heading since they were committed in
  PR #41–#46 across May 17–23 with the same broad theme (Phase A core
  + WOW dashboard). New PRs will open a fresh dated heading at the
  top.

### Fixed

- **`step8_grade.py` no longer leaves `inference_model` as the empty
  string.** A new `_resolve_inference_model(inf_results, exp_config)`
  helper resolves with the priority `inf_results['model']` →
  `experiment_yaml.condition_a.model.deployment` → `''`, never falling
  back to `config['judge']['model']`. The dashboard's previous fall-
  through `model = inference_model || judge.model` made the GradeDetail
  page show the judge model (`gpt-5.4-pro`) as if it had solved the
  tasks; the resolver guarantees `inference_model` reflects the actual
  inference deployment. Whitespace inputs are stripped on both sources.
  Three new tests in `tests/test_step8_grade.py` lock the contract,
  including a defensive `inference_model != judge.model` assertion
  independent of the literal judge string. (PR #47)

- **`grader.per_item_max_output_tokens` raised 800 → 1600 in
  `grading_configs/default_gpt5pro.yaml`.** The first smoke run on
  2026-05-21 produced `judge_error_rate = 0.2381` (20 of 84 calls
  failed); root cause hypothesis is that `gpt-5.4-pro` with
  `reasoning_effort=high` consumes most of the output-token budget on
  reasoning tokens, leaving the previous 800 ceiling insufficient to
  emit the verdict JSON. 1600 ≈ 2× safety margin without meaningful
  cost impact at the 220-task scale. (PR #47)

## [2026-05-20] — Phase A grading pipeline + WOW dashboard

### Added

- **Phase A grading infrastructure.** Added rubric-based grading pipeline
  components: `batch-runner/core/rubric_loader.py`,
  `batch-runner/core/grader.py`, `batch-runner/prompts/grader_judge.md`,
  `batch-runner/step8_grade.py`,
  `batch-runner/grading_configs/default_gpt5pro.yaml`,
  `batch-runner/schemas/grade.schema.json`,
  `.github/workflows/grade-run.yml`,
  `batch-runner/scripts/download_inference_from_hf.py`, and
  `.github/agents/grading-engineer.md`. (PR #45)

## [2026-05-20] — Phase A grading pipeline + WOW dashboard

### Added

- **Phase A grading infrastructure.** Added rubric-based grading pipeline
  components: `batch-runner/core/rubric_loader.py`,
  `batch-runner/core/grader.py`, `batch-runner/prompts/grader_judge.md`,
  `batch-runner/step8_grade.py`,
  `batch-runner/grading_configs/default_gpt5pro.yaml`,
  `batch-runner/schemas/grade.schema.json`,
  `.github/workflows/grade-run.yml`,
  `batch-runner/scripts/download_inference_from_hf.py`, and
  `.github/agents/grading-engineer.md`. (PR #45)

- **Phase A wow — narrative + dashboard integration.** Threaded schema
  v1.0 grade JSON into `NarrativeAnalyzer` + `step6_report`
  (`_load_grade_for_experiment`, `_build_grading_guard_clause`,
  `_build_grading_results_section`, N3 disclosure paragraph instruction).
  Added W1–W6 WOW components under `src/components/wow/`
  (RubricCoverageCard, CriticalItemCard, StructureVsReasoning,
  SectorHeatmap, ScoreDensityHistogram, RubricSeverityCurve) backed by
  `src/types/grade.ts` and rendered conditionally via `<WowSection>` in
  `src/pages/GradeDetail.tsx`. (PR #46)

### Removed

- **`core/evals_submitter.py` dead code.** Removed deprecated placeholder
  hosted-grading submitter and its test file
  (`tests/test_evals_submitter.py`) in favor of the new self-grading flow.
  (PR #45)

## [2026-05-17] — Resume Round watchdog + silent corruption fixes

### Fixed

- **step2_run_inference: wall-timeout watchdog now also fires inside Resume
  Rounds (silent relay-bypass fix).** Previously the `wall_deadline` check
  existed only in the Round 0 (initial run) and Relay-run continuation
  loops in `batch-runner/step2_run_inference.py`. When Round 0 completed
  within `wall_timeout`, control fell through to the Resume Round loop
  (around L1370) which had no deadline check. Heavy resume retries
  (Self-QA, audio preprocessor, video composition) then silently exceeded
  the GitHub Actions step hard timeout — on SIGKILL the run could not
  save a checkpoint or mark `pending` tasks, so the workflow saw
  `pending=0, needs_relay=false` and skipped the HF checkpoint upload +
  self-retrigger, forcing a full re-run from scratch
  (observed in run 26018603400 / exp025: Round 0 finished ~250min,
  Resume Round 1 SIGKILLed at ~330min with no relay). The Resume Round
  loop now mirrors the existing watchdog: unfinished retriable tasks are
  marked `pending(error=wall_timeout)`, `_save_progress()` is called, and
  the process exits with `EXIT_CHECKPOINT(42)` so the workflow uploads
  the checkpoint and self-retriggers. Backward compatible — `wall_timeout
  = 0` (no timeout) short-circuits the guard as before.
  (PR #41)

- **batch-run workflow: Step 2a/2b `timeout-minutes` widened 330 → 350.**
  After `wall_timeout` (default 290min) fires, the run still needs time to
  save the progress checkpoint, upload it to HuggingFace, and dispatch
  the relay re-trigger. The previous 330min hard step timeout left only
  ~40min for this handoff, which proved insufficient in practice. The new
  350min ceiling gives a 60min margin while still staying well under the
  6h job-level cap. (PR #41)

- **subprocess_runner: `_AVAILABLE_FILES` hint now actually executed.**
  In `core/subprocess_runner.py::_execute_safely`, the `files_header`
  (`_AVAILABLE_FILES = [...]`) prepended to the generated `code` string was
  never persisted back to the executed script path, so the subprocess ran the
  raw user code without the guarded hint. The header-prepended `code` is now
  written to `code_path` end-to-end. The earlier redundant pre-prepend write
  was removed; the file is written exactly once after the header is applied.

- **llm_client (Anthropic): tolerant content parsing + `finish_reason`
  surfaced.** `core/llm_client.py::AnthropicClient.chat_complete` previously
  assumed `response.content[0].text`, which crashed when the first block was
  a `thinking` or `tool_use` block. The parser now walks all content blocks
  and concatenates only `type == "text"` segments. `response.stop_reason` is
  mapped to an OpenAI-compatible `finish_reason` (`max_tokens` → `length`;
  `end_turn` / `stop_sequence` / `tool_use` passed through) and exposed on
  `_Choice` / `NormalizedResponse`, so the existing
  `finish_reason == "length"` truncation guard in
  `step2_run_inference.py:436` actually fires for Anthropic.

- **step2_run_inference: `qa_failed` is now set on genuine Self-QA
  failures.** Previously, when Self-QA scored `< min_score` and retries were
  exhausted, the best result was returned with `status == "success"`, which
  meant the `RETRIABLE_STATUSES` retry plumbing (resume rounds), the
  `_print_status` `qa_failed` branch, and the summary counters at
  `step2_run_inference.py:1419` / `1448` were all dead code paths.
  `_run_task_with_qa` now sets `best_result["status"] = "qa_failed"` on
  genuine quality failures, re-enabling auto-retry / resume.
  The `undetermined` branch is intentionally left as `success` — it only
  marks QA parse / API failures, not quality failures, and is not a retry
  target.

### Changed

- **`qa_failed` semantics (BREAKING for comparability).** As a consequence
  of the fix above, the dashboard / aggregated metric `qa_failed_count` is
  no longer comparable across the boundary: pre-fix runs report
  `qa_failed_count == 0` (the flag was never set even when QA genuinely
  failed); post-fix runs report the true count. Treat pre/post
  `qa_failed_count` as different metrics.

- **`compact` mode parquet may now contain fewer rows.** When
  `result_collector` is configured in compact mode it filters
  `status == "success"`. Because genuine QA failures now flip to
  `qa_failed`, those rows are excluded from the compact parquet that were
  previously silently retained as `success`. The non-compact / per-task
  JSON output is unaffected and remains the source of truth for QA failure
  counts.

- **`resume_rounds_used` will be non-zero on QA-enabled runs.** The same
  fix re-enables the resume / retry loop for `qa_failed` tasks via
  `RETRIABLE_STATUSES`, so QA-enabled runs that previously reported
  `resume_rounds_used == 0` may now legitimately consume one or more
  resume rounds. Worst-case per-task cost is capped by the existing
  `qa_max_retries` × `resume_rounds` × infra-retry budget.

### Notes

- **Cost guardrail (re-validated post-fix).** Production experiment YAMLs
  (`exp001`–`exp024`) keep worst-case per-task LLM call multiplier at ≤6×
  (infra retries × QA retries × resume rounds, within previous SLOs).
  Smoke YAMLs (`exp997` / `exp998` / `exp999`) sit higher at 12×–16× in the
  worst case, but their `sample_size` of 2–3 tasks bounds total wall-clock
  / spend impact to negligible levels. No YAML changes are required.
